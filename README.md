# TowerDefense

This was a project I worked on in order to learn Python in 2015. The OpenGL library is from PyGame.

It was also the project during which I learnt the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and attempted to implement it.

The program should be run by building App.py.

This README will be updated shortly in the future with correct installation steps. At some point maybe some testing will be added as well.
